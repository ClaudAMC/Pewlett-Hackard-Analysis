# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis
---
## Overview of Project

Pewlett-Hackard wants to get ahead of the incoming 'silver tsunami' and determine the number of retiring employees in different departments. They want to be prepared to train, recruit and mentor an incoming group of employees to replace the retiring employees. With this in mind my and Bobby's manager has given us more assignments regarding this retiring populations data. They want us to determine the number of retiring employees per job title and identify the employees who would be eligible to participate in a mentorship program.

## Results

### Number of Retiring Employees by Title

The file below contains the data for employees that are eligible for retirement:

[retirement_titles.csv](https://github.com/ClaudAMC/Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis/blob/main/Data/retirement_titles.csv)

The file below contains the data containg the unique job titles for employees

[unique_titles.csv](https://github.com/ClaudAMC/Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis/blob/main/Data/unique_titles.csv)

The table containing the count of retiring employees by job title can be found in the file and image below:

1. From this we can see that a large majority of the retiring population holds the title of Senior Engineer or Senior Staff. This means that the majority of the retiring employees are senior employees. The company should look to see it there are employees who currently hold the junior positions that could be transitioned into a senior role as the need arises. This way it can ease the gradual loss of senior employees. At the same time they need to look to hire more junior employees.

2. Secondly, we can see that there are only 2 retiring Managers. This means that the company can rest alittle easier where they won't need to worry too much about replacing the retiring management team.

### Employees Eligible for the Mentorship Program

The file below contains the employee information for employees who are eligible for the mentorship program.

[mentorship_eligibility.csv](https://github.com/ClaudAMC/Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis/blob/main/Data/mentorship_eligibility.csv)

The image below show the tail of the mentorship eligibility table:

![Tail of Mentorship Eligibility Table.PNG](https://github.com/ClaudAMC/Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis/blob/main/Tail%20of%20Mentorship%20Eligibility%20Table.PNG)

From this table we can see that there are 1549 eligible employees for the mentorship program. Of these further analysis could be done to see who is and is not a senior staff member. This could further help managment decided who will or won't be in the mentorship program.
