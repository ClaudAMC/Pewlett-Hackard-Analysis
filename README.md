# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis
---
##Overview of Project

Pewlett-Hackard wants to get ahead of the incoming 'silver tsunami' and determine the number of retiring employees in different departments. They want to be prepared to train, recruit and mentor an incoming group of employees to replace the retiring employees. With this in mind my and Bobby's manager has given us more assignments regarding this retiring populations data. They want us to determine the number of retiring employees per job title and identify the employees who would be eligible to participate in a mentorship program.
